# CRUML
An AI Generated UML designing tool

This tool was created using Gemini and my knowledge of UML. Almost all the code is written by AI and I only made a few corrections in a few places to make it more presentable. This is a proof of concept that amazing teaching tools can be created by proper prompting AI and testing it repeatedly. As academics, I am of the opinion to embrace AI in our teaching activities and develop ideas that we once thought would take a lot of time to complete. Do try CRUML and maybe it just might inspire you to make AI generated learning tools of your own.
